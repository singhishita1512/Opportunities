		<h1>SCHOOL LEVEL EXAMS</h1>
			<p>
				With most children joining coaching classes at a very early stage, the pressure on their peers increase multifold. While the debate
				on whether this is a good practice or not doesn't seem to come to an end anytime soon, we have compiled a data of the exams that students
				they can give depending on their interests. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Many a times students miss out on opportunities because of lack of information and participating in exams like these not only help them in finding
				their interests but also give them a knack of how most competitive exams are conducted. Moreover, a lot of these exams are scholarship tests
				which aim on helping meritorious students from weaker sections.
